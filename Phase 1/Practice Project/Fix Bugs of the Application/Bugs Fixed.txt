1. ArrayList<Integer> arrlist = new ArrayList<Integer>(); -	

	a. We dont need this statement. 
	b. Because we already have - ArrayList<Integer> expenses = new ArrayList<Integer>();
	c. Hence I have deleted.


2. Made the expense arraylist a private static arraylist


3. expenses.addAll(arrlist); -
	
	a. We dont need this statement. 
	b. Because we don't need to append all of the elements in the specified collection
	c. Hence I have deleted.


4.  int[] arr1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
    int  slen = arr1.length;

	a. We dont need this statement.
	b. Because in for loop we have used arr[i].
	c. Hence I have deleted.


5. Filled cases 4 and 5


6. sortExpenses 
	
	a. Completed the method. 
	b. The expenses sorted in ascending order.


7. mergeSort

	a. small list don't need to be merged
	b. The arraylist is empty.
	c. The values are in the temporary ones. 


8. mergeSort(left); 
 
	recursive call to further divide left
